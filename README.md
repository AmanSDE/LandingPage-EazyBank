#Key Concepts used
~ CSS padding
~ CSS flexbox
~ js script is just for toggle buttons on mobile devices.

#note
I have used scss for better formatting of code, and it of course resembles CSS in almost all the means except just better when it comes to formatiing of flexbox
~ one of the key insights of the project was the scalability issue for smaller and larger devices.
~ used REM instead of PIXEL to adjust it to the needs.
